# ELE201 Assignment 2 
I did this assignment alone (data network part with Holly, Gunnar and Malene).

For the first task, the video I produced does not reflect the final code as I had simply made the button switch the light directly to red. I modified the code later to better solve the task as it was described. There is also a slight cut in the video as I accidentally pressed pause on the video for a second.
